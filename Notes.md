We use `git clone` when we have a repo on github, and want to copy that repo onto a local machine. Once it is cloned, it will already have defined the remote origin so that the local and remote repos stay "linked." 

Very often, we first fork a repo we want to make a copy of on our own github account, and then clone that!
